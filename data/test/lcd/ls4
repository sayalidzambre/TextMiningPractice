DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT

Referring to FIG. 1, the preferred embodiment of an LCD screen device according to the present invention is shown to comprise a rectangular LCD screen unit 1 and an upright support 2 mounted on a computer casing 3 for supporting the LCD screen unit 1.

As shown in FIG. 2, the LCD screen unit 1 includes a front display side 13 and a back side 10. The back side 10 has a central portion 11 which is a circular rearwardly projecting portion and which has a tubular rearwardly extending projection 115. With reference to FIG. 5, a journal member 22 has a hollow neck part 223 which receives and which is screwed to the rearwardly extending projection 115, and a clamping flange 225 which extends radially and outwardly from an end of the neck part 223 opposite to the LCD screen unit 1.

With reference to FIGS. 2, 3 and 4, the support 2 includes a vertical flat support portion 20 which has a guide rail 23 to confine a guide hole 230 for permitting the neck part 223 to pass horizontally therethrough. The guide hole 230 is elongated in a vertical direction and has a vertical longitudinal axis, and opposite interconnecting upper and lower rounded hole parts 230 a, 230 b with horizontal transverse axes that cross the vertical longitudinal axis. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the guide rail 23 has a front slide face 23 a in contact with the central portion 11, and a rear slide face 23 b in contact with the clamping flange 225.

Referring again to FIGS. 2 and 3, a limiting mechanism for limiting the turning angle of the LCD screen unit 1 includes an upper engagement notch 232 which is formed in the guide rail 23 in connection with the upper hole part 230 a, and a lower engagement notch 231 which is formed in the guide rail 23 in connection with the lower hole part 230 b. The lower engagement notch 231 is provided substantially at a location where the vertical axis of the guide hole 230 meets the guide rail 23. The upper engagement notch 232 is provided substantially at a location where the horizontal transverse axis of the upper hole part 230 a meets the guide rail 23. An engagement projection 224 (see FIG. 5) is formed on the neck part 223 to engage the upper engagement notch 232 when the neck part 223 is received in the upper hole part 230 a, and to engage the lower engagement notch 231 when the neck part 223 is received in the lower hole part 230 b. A tongue 21 is provided on the flat support portion 20 above the upper hole part 230 a substantially in alignment with the vertical axis of the guide hole 230. A limit groove 12 is formed in the back side 10, and includes a vertical slide groove 121 which extends upward from the circumference of the central portion 11 along the direction of the vertical axis of the guide hole 230, and an arched slide groove 122 which extends along the circumference of the central portion 11 and which has one end connected to the vertical slide groove 121 and which extends to an angular distance of substantially 90 degrees so as to receive slidably the tongue 21 and so as to limit the movement of the tongue 21 when the LCD screen unit 1 is turned relative to the support 2.

A locking mechanism for locking the LCD screen unit 1 against turning movement includes a plurality of latch holes 112 which are formed in the circular rearwardly projecting portion of the central portion 11 and which are circumferentially spaced apart by an angle of 90 degrees. Two latch members 34 are provided on the flat support portion 20 at one side of the guide hole 230 in a vertically spaced relationship. One of the latch members 34 engages releasably the corresponding latch hole 112 when the LCD screen unit 1 is in the first position. The other latch member 34 engages the corresponding other latch hole 112 after the LCD screen unit 1 is turned 90 degrees. The flat support portion 20 is formed with two hollow seats 242 to permit passage of the latch members 34. Two mounting members 33 have holes 331 and are mounted respectively on the hollow seats 242. Each latch member 34 is loaded with a spring 35. When the latch member 34 is not locked, it is biased by the spring 35 toward the corresponding latch hole 112. An elongated locking member 3 is mounted on the flat support portion 20, and includes a movable locking plate 31 which is provided adjacent to the latch members 34 opposite to the latch holes 112 and which extends in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the biasing of the springs 35 so as to lock the latch members 34 in the latching position thereof relative to the latch holes 112. The locking plate 31 is perforated to form two releasing holes 313. When the latch members 34 and the holes 331 of the mounting member 33 are aligned with the releasing holes 313 respectively, the latch members 34 are movable outward from the latch holes 112 against the action of the springs 35. The latch members 34 are locked in the latch holes 112 when they are not in alignment with the releasing holes 313. In addition, the locking plate 31 has a lower end 315 which is releasably inserted into a lock unit 36 that is secured on the flat support portion 20. The lock unit 36 is conventional and is able to hold therein the lower end 315 of the locking plate 31 when the latter is pushed into the former. When the lower end 315 is pushed toward the lock unit 36, the lower end 315 can be released from the lock unit 36. A spring 32 is provided longitudinally in the locking plate 31, and has one end abutting against the flat support portion 20 to actuate the locking plate 31 upward when the lower end 315 is released from the lock unit 36. The locking plate 31 further has an upper push button 311 that projects upward from a hole 27 formed in the flat support portion 20 for manual pushing operation.

In order to reinforce the connection of the LCD screen unit 1 and the support 2 when the LCD screen unit 1 is locked, two additional latch members 261 are provided on the support 2 to engage releasably the latch holes 112 on the other side of the guide hole 230. Two mounting members 262 are mounted on the flat support portion 2 to hold the latch members 261, respectively. Each latch member 261 is loaded with a spring 263 like the latch members 34.

FIG. 6 shows the LCD screen unit 1 according to this invention in a first position where the length of the LCD screen unit 1 lies horizontally. With reference to FIG. 2, in this state, the neck part 223 is received in the lower hole part 230 b. The engagement projection 224 engages the lower engagement notch 231, and one of the latch members 34 and one of the latch members 261 engage corresponding two of the latch holes 112 on two opposite sides of the guide hole 230 to lock the LCD screen unit 1 against movement relative to the flat support portion 20.

For changing the LCD screen unit 1 into a second position where the width of the LCD screen unit 1 lies horizontally, the upper push button 311 is first pushed downward so that the releasing holes 313 are aligned with the latch members 34 to permit the latch members 34, 261 to pass therethrough, thereby releasing the latch members 34 from the latch holes 112. With reference to FIG. 7, the LCD screen unit 1 is lifted upward and is subsequently rotated clockwise about 90 degrees in such a manner that the tongue 21 slides along the limit groove 12 from the top of the vertical slide groove 121 to the other end of the arched slide groove 122. After the engagement projection 224 engages the upper engagement notch 232, the other one of the latch members 34 and the other one of the latch members 261 engage the corresponding latch holes 112 to lock the LCD screen unit 1 against movement relative to the flat support portion 20.

As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, note that the bottom end (L) of the LCD screen unit 1 lies on the same horizontal plane when placed in the first or second positions because the LCD screen unit 1 is lifted during the change from the first position to the second position.

Moreover, the LCD screen unit 1 is lifted and rotated stably by virtue of the engagement between the tongue 21 and the groove 12.

While the present invention has been described in connection with what is considered the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is understood that this invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment but is intended to cover various arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the broadest interpretations and equivalent arrangements in accordance with the invention defined by the appended claims.
