    [0037]
    The control unit 160 controls supply of power to the components of the mobile terminal 100 for initialization, and controls the components to provide a user interface for supporting divided screen areas and to perform requested operations. In particular, the control unit 160 controls an operation to demarcate the display unit 141 into two areas according to properties of activated user functions, and outputs functional view areas related to the user functions to the two areas.
    [0038]
    Referring to FIG. 3, when a first user function and a second user function, which are independent of each other, are activated at one of the same time and in sequence, as illustrated in screen 301, the control unit 160 can control the display unit 141 to divide the screen into two areas, and cause a functional view area A.App for the first user function to be displayed on one area and cause a functional view area B.App for the second user function to be displayed on the other area. The functional view area A.App and the functional view area B.App can include an image and a text string depending upon the first and second user functions. For example, if the first user function is related to music playback, the functional view area A.App can include a control key map for controlling music playback and an image depicting the music file being played back. If the second user function is related to message composition, the functional view area B.App can include a key map and a message composition view area for composing a message.
    [0039]
    When two instances of a user function are activated, the control unit 160 can control the display unit 141 to divide the screen into two areas, and cause two functional view areas to be displayed on the corresponding areas as illustrated in screen 302. For example, when a first user function being a message composition function is activated, the control unit 160 can control the display unit 141 to display one of a message composition view area in a full screen format and to display a message composition view area and a key map in a full screen format. Thereafter, when the user activates a second user function being the message composition function, the control unit 160 controls the display unit 141 to divide the screen into two areas, to display a functional view area A1.App (i.e., resized message composition view area) for the first user function on one area, and to display a functional view area A2.App for the second user function on the other area. For another example, when the user activates an application requiring two Web connections, the control unit 160 can control the display unit 141 to display a functional view area A1.App as to one Web connection and a functional view area A2.App as to the other Web connection on the corresponding areas.
    [0040]
    When related user functions are activated, the control unit 160 can control the display unit 141 to divide the screen into two areas, and cause two functional view areas to be displayed on the corresponding areas as illustrated in screen 303. For example, when the user activates a message composition function first and then activates a file search function for message composition, the control unit 160 can control the display unit 141 to divide the screen into two areas, to display a functional view area A.App as to the message composition function on one area, and to display a functional view area LinkA.App as to the file search function on the other area. Hence, the user can compose a message using the functional view area A.App displayed on one area and can find and attach a necessary file using the functional view area LinkA.App displayed on the other area.
    [0041]
    When a user function is activated first and then a sub function thereof is activated, the control unit 160 can control the display unit 141 to divide the screen into two areas, and cause two functional view areas to be displayed on the corresponding areas as illustrated in screen 304. For example, when a message search function is activated for received messages, the control unit 160 can control the display unit 141 to display a list of all received messages in a full screen format. Thereafter, when a user input signal is generated to select and view a received message of the list, the control unit 160 can activate a sub user function for selecting and viewing a desired received message. Here, the control unit 160 can control the display unit 141 to divide the screen into two areas, to display a functional view area A.App as to the message search function on one area, and to display a functional view area SubA.App as to the message viewing function on the other area.
    [0042]
    As described above, the control unit 160 can control the display unit 141 to divide the screen into different areas, and cause functional view areas associated with any of independent user functions, instances of the same user function, related user functions, and main and subordinate user functions, to be displayed on the corresponding areas.
    [0043]
    Next, a description is given of divided screen area formation in connection with FIGS. 4A to 4E.
    [0044]
    Referring to FIG. 4A, the user of the mobile terminal 100 can generate an input signal to display a plurality of one of menu items and widget items. As illustrated in screen 401, the mobile terminal 100 can display a plurality of menu items on the screen in response to an input signal. The plurality of menu items can include a dual menu item, which is to be displayed on divided screen areas. Here, when a dual menu item is activated, the screen of the display unit 141 is divided into two areas and two functional view areas as to two menus are displayed on the two areas. A dual menu item can be one of created according to design settings and be created when the user combines two menu items together. The mobile terminal 100 can provide a special menu that enables the user to combine two selected menu items together into a dual menu item. In screen 401, menu items E, F, G, H, I, J, K and L are a single menu item, and menu items “AB”, “CB” and “CD” are a dual menu items.
    [0045]
    When the user selects a dual menu item “AB” in screen 401, the mobile terminal 100 can activate application programs related to the menu items A and B, display a functional view area App.A as to the application program related to the menu item A on a divided screen area, and display a functional view area App.B as to the application program related to the menu item B on the other divided screen area, as illustrated in screen 403. As described above, the mobile terminal 100 can provide a feature for setting a dual menu item and output a functional view area related to the dual menu item to the divided screen areas.
    [0046]

In this case, the mobile terminal 100 can control the display unit 141 to divide the screen into two areas, and cause functional view areas to be displayed on the corresponding areas. That is, the mobile terminal 100 can display the functional view area App.A (presented immediately before pressing the ‘Home’ key) on the left divided screen area, and display the functional view area App.C (presented in relation to the function ‘C’ before the function ‘A’) on the right divided screen area. The mobile terminal 100 can move a functional view area to another divided screen area in response to occurrence of, for example, a drag event. When the ‘Home’ key is pressed again during display of divided screen areas, the mobile terminal 100 can return to the previous screen as illustrated in screen 413. As described above, when two functional view areas are related to each other through an event history, the mobile terminal 100 can simultaneously present the two functional view areas on the divided screen areas.
    [0048]
    Referring to FIG. 4C, when the user generates an input signal to activate a function ‘A’, the mobile terminal 100 can display a functional view area App.A as to the function ‘A’ on the display unit 141, as illustrated in screen 421. Thereafter, when the user generates an input signal to activate a sub task of the function ‘A’ in screen 421, the mobile terminal 100 activates the sub task, and can display a functional view area A_Main as to the function ‘A’ on one divided screen area and display a functional view area A_Sub as to the sub task on the other divided screen area as illustrated in screen 423. Here, the functional view area A_Main in screen 423 is one of a resized and a simplified version of the functional view area App.A in screen 421. The divided screen areas to which the functional view area A_Main and functional view area A_Sub are output can be any of fixed, altered, and randomly determined according to user settings.
    [0049]
    When the sub task A_Sub one of ends and is terminated by the user, the mobile terminal 100 can output a functional view area App.A-1 reflecting the result of the sub task A_Sub to the display unit 141 in a full screen format, as illustrated in screen 425.
    [0050]
    As an example for the case in FIG. 4C, when the user generates an input signal to activate a message composition program, the mobile terminal 100 can display a functional view area App.A (a message composition view area) as to the message composition program on the screen, as illustrated in screen 421. Thereafter, when the user generates an input signal for finding an attached file, the mobile terminal 100 can output a functional view area A_Sub as to the file search function as illustrated in screen 423. Here, the functional view area App.A (message composition view area) in screen 421 can be one of resized and changed in attribute into the functional view area A_Main as illustrated in screen 423. Thereafter, when the user selects an image in the functional view area A_Sub and attaches the selected image to the functional view area A_Main, the mobile terminal 100 can output a functional view area App.A-1 as to a message with an attached image in a full screen format as illustrated in screen 425. When the user generates an input signal for ending file search, the mobile terminal 100 can return to screen 421. As described above, when a function and subordinate function are activated, the mobile terminal 100 can output functional view areas related to the function and subordinate function to divided screen areas.
    [0051]
    Referring to FIG. 4D, the user of the mobile terminal 100 can generate an input signal for activating a function ‘A’, the mobile terminal 100 can display a functional view area App.A as to the function ‘A’ on the display unit 141, as illustrated in screen 431. Thereafter, when an event corresponding to one of a schedule and a condition is generated, the mobile terminal 100 can activate an application program for handling the event and output a functional view area as to the event handling application program to the display unit 141. Here, as illustrated in screen 433, the mobile terminal 100 can display the functional view area App.A as to the function ‘A’ on one divided screen area through resizing, and display a functional view area Event as to the event handling application program on the other divided screen area.
    [0052]
    As an example for the case in FIG. 4C, when the user generates an input signal to activate a function ‘A’ for moving image playback, the mobile terminal 100 can display a functional view area App.A as to moving image playback on the display unit 141 in a full screen format, as illustrated in screen 431. Thereafter, when an incoming call is received, the mobile terminal 100 can generate an alert for call reception, and output a functional view area related to call event handling to the display unit 141. Here, as illustrated in screen 433, the mobile terminal 100 can display the functional view area App.A as to the function ‘A’ on one divided screen area, and display a functional view area Event as to call event handling on the other divided screen area.
    [0053]
    As depicted above, in response to reception of an incoming call, the mobile terminal 100 can output a functional view area related to call event handling to the display unit 141. In the case of a call event, as the user normally grips the mobile terminal 100 and moves it close to the user's face, the mobile terminal 100 can pause moving image playback and turn off the display unit 141 to save battery power. When the incoming call is ended, the mobile terminal 100 can return to screen 431.
    [0054]
    In response to a schedule alert event, the mobile terminal 100 can output a functional view area (an alert message) related to schedule alert handling to the left divided screen area, as illustrated in screen 433. Here, as handling of a schedule alert event is not in conflict with playback of moving images, the functional view area related to playback of moving images can be retained. Options for playback of moving images including continue and pause can be set by the design and changed by the user. As described above, in response to occurrence of one of an external and internal event when a functional view area related to a user function is output in a full screen format, the mobile terminal can display the functional view area related to the event and the functional view area related to the user function on divided screen areas.
    [0055]
