GLOBAL VILLAGE STORIES – A relational art project
Description:
128 very short stories in English language (at most 4 lines) were exhibited in the gallery space in
The Art Folk High School, Holbæk, Denmark. They were framed in 20 A4 frames, that is
around 6-7 stories per frame. It was part of the North West Zealand Juried Exhibition, 2009.
They have been collected using the Internet in the period February-April 2009. They are coming
from more than 50 different countries. Some contributors have sent more than one story. Some
were too long then I have shortened; others were not in English language then I have to translate
them.
In this note I present my theoretical reflections about this dynamic and relational art project and
how it will evolve in time. These are aposterior reflections since the start and the first exhibition
were not planed at all, it evolve in a very intuitive manner.
Global Village:
Today, the term Global Village is mostly used as a metaphor to describe the Internet and World
Wide Web. On the Internet, physical distance is even less of a hindrance to the real-time
communicative activities of people, and therefore social spheres are greatly expanded by the
openness of the web and the ease at which people can search for online communities and
interact with others that share the same interests and concerns. Therefore, this technology fosters
the idea of a conglomerate yet unified global community. Due to the enhanced speed of
communication online and the ability of people to read about, spread, and react to global news
very rapidly, this forces us to become more involved with one another from countries around the
world and be more aware of our global responsibilities. Similarly, web-connected computers
enable people to link their web sites together. This new reality has implications for forming new
sociological structures within the context of culture.
This art project involves the Internet, permitting social communication and participation about a
theme (stories) that exists in any culture as well as in the Global Village. In all cultures and in
all times story telling has been a central activity. Stories or narratives have been shared in every
culture and in every land as a means of entertainment, education, preservation of culture and in
order to instill moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot and
characters, as well as the narrative point of view.
Stories as readymades:
The readymades as conceptualized by Marcel Duchamp are ordinary manufactured objects that
he selected and modified, as an antidote to what he called "retinal art". By simply choosing the
object (or objects) and repositioning or joining, and tilting and signing it, the object became art.
It was the least amount of interaction between artist and art, and the most extreme form of
minimalism that had yet been seen at the time.
Duchamp was unable to define or explain his opinion of readymades: "The curious thing about
the readymade is that I've never been able to arrive at a definition or explanation that fully
satisfies me.” Duchamp was not interested in what he called "retinal art" — art that was only
visual — and sought other methods of expression. As an antidote to "retinal art" he began
creating readymades at a time (1915) when the term was commonly used in the United States to
describe manufactured items to distinguish them from handmade goods. He selected the pieces
on the basis of "visual indifference” and the selections reflect his sense of irony, humour and
ambiguity."...it was always the idea that came first, not the visual example", he said, "...a formof denying the possibility of defining art." The only definition of "readymade" published under
the name of Marcel Duchamp ("MD" to be precise) says in André Breton and Paul Éluard's
Dictionnaire abrégé du Surréalisme: "an ordinary object elevated to the dignity of a work of art
by the mere choice of an artist."
In this sense, the collected stories are to me readymades, they are ordinary “objects”, they are
not necessarily work of art, most of them are not, but they will become part of an art project. I
do not evaluate them; I have not dismissed any story. Many of them are “modified” readymades
in the sense that some were too long and I have to reduce them or some of them were send in a
language that was not English and I have to translate them. What is important in this project is
the story, the date and the country where the story is coming from. The person sending the story
or the author of the story is in principle irrelevant and according to the rules of the Internet most
of them are anonymous. This is similar to Duchamp ́s pissoir; it is irrelevant who made the
pissoir. Moreover, recently some people have preferred to remain anonymous.
Relational Art - the process and the product:
Some visitors of the gallery, looking for traditional art, searching for “sublime” paintings or
sculptures, probably looking for investment objects, have difficulties in understanding this art
project. They will usually ask: Is this art? What is the price?
To better understand this project, it is necessary to introduce the concept of Relational Art.
According to Nicolas Bourriaud, Relational Art encompasses a set of artistic practices which
take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their
social context, rather than an independent and private space.
The artwork creates a social environment in which people come together to participate in a
shared activity. The role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and utopian realities, but to
actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real, whatever scale chosen
by the artist.
In Relational Art, the audience is envisaged as a community. Rather than the artwork being an
encounter between a viewer and an object, relational art produces intersubjective encounters.
Through these encounters, meaning is elaborated collectively, rather than in the space of
individual consumption. Participation is an essential element of Relational Art.
In this specific project, the artist has used the Internet to create a space where people could send
very short stories, in this way everybody could participate, no censorship; the only demand was
that the stories should be of at most four lines. The important parts were the story, the date and
the country of origin. Some people were refused participation because they wanted to appear in
the project with their name, e-mail and Web site. The authors or story creators are anonymous.
This was the beginning of a process, the interaction of the creator of the project and the
contributors of stories. Some stories were modified, corrected, make shorter or translated to
English language. This was a very fast process, after two months more than 100 stories have
been collected.
This process ends when the creator was invited to an exhibition in Denmark, he presented five
installations, and one of them was the exhibition of the first 128 stories. The products of this
process were framed and shown around the gallery. In the exhibition another participative
element was introduced: The visitors were invited to contribute with their own stories that will
be included the next time the stories will be shown in another exhibition.No marketable Art:
This art project is not for sale, it has by definition no market value. On the contrary, each story
can be considered as a present, as those candies that Felix-Gonzales Torres was offering in the
gallery. You can appropriate a story, take it out of its context, and used in your social context. In
this respect this art project is a critique of money dependency of traditional art.
The irrational exuberance of the contemporary art market is about the breeding of money, not
the fertility of art, and that commercially precious works of art have become the organ grinder's
monkeys of money. They exist to increase the generative value and staying power of money -
the power of money to breed money, to fertilize itself - not the value and staying power of art.
Art has never been independent of money, but now it has become a dependency of money.
Consciousness of money is all-pervasive. Money has always invested in art, as though admiring,
even worshipping, what it respected as its superior - the true treasure of civilization - but today
money's hyper-investment in art, implicitly an attempt to overwhelm it, to force it to surrender
its supposedly higher values, strongly suggests that money regards itself as superior to art.
Art's willingness, even eagerness to be absorbed by money - to aestheticize money, as it were -
suggests that art, like every other enterprise, from the cultural to the technological (and culture
has become an extension and even mode of technological practice in many quarters) is a way of
making and worshipping money - a way of affirming capitalism.
The old technology of painting remains the most successful way of making money, suggesting
that painting, however supposedly dead or in mourning for itself remains economically viable.
Even more interestingly, money's respectability has made once disrespectful avant-garde art - art
once scornfully irreverent towards capitalist society, art that claimed to be a spiritual revolution
against its material values - respectable.
Money no longer serves and supports art, art serves and supports money. Money is timeless and
transcendental, and anyone - artist or otherwise - who abandons his or her bank-book looks like
a self-destructive fool. Escalating auction prices confirm that the capitalization of art is
complete. Money has completely conquered art; indeed, art has become a species of money.
Collectors and dealers look like conquistadors, cornering the market in a particular art to extract
the last bit of money from it. They pan for gold in art, search for the holy grail of gold,
indifferent to the meaning it had for the natives who valued artistic gold because it had the
radiance of the sun god, symbolized its life-giving power.
Only art that makes money finds its way into the textbooks, which sometimes seem like
rationalizations of auction results. Official art history tends to follow the lead of the art markets,
consciously as well as unconsciously.
Growing and Travelling Art:
This art project is expansive in the sense that it is still growing and at the exhibition people are
asked to send more stories, by the time being (May 2009), there are more than 200 stories.
I am in contact with other countries and galleries who are interesting in showing the stories too.Creativity in Art:
This project illustrates how creativity can interact with the development of an art project.
Everything starts with a simple idea: to collects very short stories from different parts of the
world using the Internet. There is not a specific purpose, neither strategy nor goal to achieve an
art work.
The responds from my network was very fast and positive; in addition many people used their
networks to spread the idea all around the World. This is probably due to the fact that I have a
close contact with my network. They will get a message from me about art every week.
Having collected more than 100 stories, the idea of exhibit them was rather obvious. Since I was
invited to an exhibition in Denmark to present some installations I decided to shown the stories
for the first time in Denmark. Then later I got information about the Global Village exhibition in
Holland, where this Art Project will suite perfectly. In creativity we call this: serendipity.
And the creative process goes on. The art project is evolving, more stories are coming. When
and how this will stop? I do not really know.
Final remarks:
Travel, cultural exchanges and examination of history are not merely fashionable themes, but
markers of a profound evolution in our vision of the world and our way of inhabiting it. More
generally, our globalize perception calls for new types of representation: our daily lives are
played out against a more enormous backdrop than ever before, and depend now on
transnational entities, short or long-distance journeys in a chaotic and teeming universe. Many
signs suggest that the multiculturalism and the discourse of identity is being overtaken by a
planetary movement of creolisation; cultural relativism, relational aesthetics and deconstruction.
The times seem propitious for the recomposition of modernity in the present, reconfigured
according to the specific context within which we live – crucially in the age of globalisation –
understood in its economic, political and cultural aspects. The artist becomes 'homo viator', the
prototype of the contemporary traveller whose passage through signs and formats refers to a
contemporary experience of mobility, travel and transpassing. This evolution can be seen in the
way works are made: a new type of form is appearing, the journey-form, made of lines drawn
both in space and time, materialising trajectories rather than destinations. Creativity becomes art
and art becomes creativity. The form of the work expresses a course, a wandering, rather than a
fixed space-time. Flight-lines, translation programmes and chains of heterogeneous elements
articulate each other. Our universe becomes a territory all dimensions of which may be travelled
both in time and space.

NOTHING GREAT
Once there was a conference of religions to which all faiths sent their representatives. Every
representative stated forcefully that his religion was great. When it was the turn of Zen's
representative, he stated truthfully: "There is nothing great in Zen".

THE SIXTH ART
The worst of it was not the eternal position, the brazenness of the pigeons, the indifference of
the locals or the flashes of the tourists. The worst was that until now no any idiot who had come
at the front has had the idea that a statue could also have their own spiritual life.

I drove 150 miles to see one of my favourite singers in concert. Before I got out of the car I

CARELESS
I went to the store to buy groceries. I didn't care how I looked, so I wore an old shirt that said,

COMPLAINT

bring to you, says Kabir to his son

SHOPPING
I was buying an expensive pillow for my mother from a store clerk who wouldn't stop staring at
my boobs. After paying, I saw an elderly lady who had dropped a bag, so I walked to help. I
walked back to the clerk, who refused to believe I paid. The reason? He didn't recognize my
face.

José wanted to be a nudist but he had a problem. His little friend was an exhibitionist. In the

sleeping.
