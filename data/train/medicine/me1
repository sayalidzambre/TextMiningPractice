The lock 96 with the keeper 95 is now in a position to be moved along a way 100 in the cabinet front 5 and thereby move the elongate bar 94 by means of the linkage 97. Each time the lock is moved along the way 100 a single unit of medicine is dispensed from the selected magazine 7.

Each of the keys 98 has a plurality :of projections 101 along one edge for unlocking the lock 96 and permitting the lever or keeper 95 to also be turned through the same 90 ngle. The opposite edge of the keys 98 also has one or more projections 101' positioned therealong to serve 'as a representative code designation of the person having the respective key 98.

The keys 98 with the respective representative code designation are operative to activate a suitable recorder 102 during movement of the lock 96 along the way 100 and record the code designation of the person operating the medicine dispensing apparatus 1. The recorder 102 is operatively connected to the selector knob 81 thereby also recording the particular type of medicine dispensed. A suitable time clock 103 is also operatively connected to the recorder I02 thereby recording the precise time of the dispensing of the selected medicine. 1

A side door 104 provides access to the recorder 102. It is preferred that only selected key personnel, such as a head floor nurse in a hospital or a chief pharmacist or the like, having access to the recorded information especially when the medicine dispensing apparatus 1 contains sensitive medicine, such as narcotics. The. recorder 102 is also particularly' adapted for inventory control information in that quantity of each type of medicine is recorded and may be used to reorder new magazines 7 containing the medicine supply exhausted.

A plurality of suitable indicators, such as light bulbs 105, are positioned to indicate the respective magazines 7 with which the rod 83 is aligned. In the illustrated structure, the bulbs 105 are mounted on the cabinet front 5 where a suitable switch such as an enclosed normally open switch 106 having one lead connected to the respective bulb 105 and the other leadconnected to a suitable power source (not shown), such as a battery contained within the medicine dispensing apparatus l or a suitable electrical outlet. A suitable magnet 107 is mounted on the carriage 82 adjacent the line of switches 106 and is operative to close the normally open switch immediately adjacent the carriage 82 thereby completing the circuit to the respective bulb 105.

It is also preferable that a suitable table 108 be mounted on the cabinet 2, as for example on the front door 4 with the table 108 listing the contents of each of the magazines 7 thereby assisting a person in selecting the desired type of medicine.

In operation a person, such as a nurse, desiring a single unit of a certain type of medicine moves the selector knob 81 to align the rod 83 with the respective stem portion 58 of the from' .-.the abutment member 99; and moves the key 98 downwardly in the way 100 thereby dispensing a single unit of medicine from the selected magazine 7. The unit of medicine is ejected or discharged into the hopper 3 and moves by gravity into a chute 109 and comes to rest on a normally closed trap door 110. The person making the selection then takes a suitable receptacle or container, such as a paper-or plastic cup (not shown), and places the receptacle or container against a lever 1 11 and moves same rearwardly overcoming the force of a suitable resilient member, such as tension spring 112, and removing the support for the trap door [10 thereby permitting the door 110 to open. In the illustrated'structure, the lever l l land the trap door 110 are pivotably mounted about pin 113; the selected unit of medicine thereby falling into the container from which apatient may take the medicine.

All of the medicine in the medicine dispensing apparatus 1 is protected from human contact or other contamination from the time the medicine is enclosed in the respective magazines 7 until dispensed through the chute 109 and trap door 110 into the container thereby removing a possible source of contamination to recipients of the dispensed medicine.

A selection is made by moving a selected pushbutton 115 inwardly to'position an interposer 1 16 under the elongate bar 94 and to align the interposer 116 with the stem portion 58 of the blade 55. The interposer I16 has an enlarged upper and lowerend portions 117 with the upper end portion 117 positioned to be engaged by the elongate bar 94 upon operation of the lever or keeper of the lock 96 to engage the lower end portion 117 with the stem portion 58 of the plunger 53 so as to move the selected magazine 7 to its medicine dispensing position 20.

It is desirable to maintain the pushbutton in a depressed or inward position to indicate the last selection made and to be locked in said depressed or inward position wherein a bar 118 extends from each pushbutton 115 and the bar 118 has a locking notch 119 in an upper surface thereof to receive a pawl or lock bail 120. The pawl or lock bail 120 is positioned above the bar l 18 and is spring loaded or biased to move into the locking notch 119 when the respective bar "8 is moved inwardly.

The bar 118 has a suitable magnet 121 mounted therein which is moved to a position adjacent a line of normally open switches 122. Each switch 122 is aligned with a respective bar 118 and the magnet 121 therein is operative to close the respective normally open switch 122 aligned therewith thereby completing a circuit to the respective bulb 105. The switches 122 may be operatively connected to and activate other components, such as relays for printout information, such as the magazine selected and the like.

It is desirable to provide means for moving the pawl or locking bail 120 out of the locking notch 119 and to cancel the previous selection. FIG. 13 illustrates a linkage 123 which is operatively connected to a cancel button (not shown) thereby providing means to cancel an erroneous selection of a magazine 7, such as one not having the desired medicine therein. Each bar 118 has a slight cam rise 124 positioned adjacent the locking notch 119 therein and positioned to engage and raise the locking pawl or bail 120 when the respective bar 118 is moved inwardly by the pushbutton 115.

In use, the respective pushbutton 115 is pushed inwardly thereby moving the bar 118, to the right as shown in FIG. 13, and engaging the locking pawl or bail 120 with the cam rise 124 thereby positioning the notch 119 to receive the pawl 120 by the operation of the resilient member (not shown) biasing the lock pawl or bail 120 downwardly so as to move into the locking notch 119 of the bar 1180f the presently operated pushbutton 115.

The key 98 is placed in the lock 96 and turned to operate the lever or keeper 95 to move the bar 94, through operation of the linkage 97, to engage the upper portion 117 of the interposer 116 and move same downwardly to operate the plunger 53 to dispense the selected medicine.

FIG. 14 illustrates some of the components of the recorder 102 which is positioned adjacent the lock 96. The respective keys 98 are inserted into the lock 96 thereby operating the lever or keeper 95 wherein each of the projections 101' engage a respective contact surface 125 of one of a plurality of slides 126 mounted in suitable ways or guide grooves (not shown) to move same, to the left as shown in FIG. 14, against the resistance of a suitable resilient member, such as a spring 127. The spring 127 has one end mounted on the respective slide 126 and has the opposite opposite end mounted on a limit block 128 positioned to limit the movement of the respective slide 126, to the right as shown in FIG. 14, within the recorder 102 and to position the respectivecontact surface 125 in a position to be engaged by the respective projection 101' of the keys 98.

A plurality of print wheels 129 are each rotatably mounted on an elongate shaft 130 and the print wheels 129 each have a gear 131 thereon for interengagement with a respective gear lever 132 which operatively engages a respective slide 126 to turn or rotate the print wheel 129 in response to movement of the slide 126 thereby aligning same for printing information concerning the respective key designation. The print wheels 129 each have a plurality of circumferentially spaced print characters 133 on the periphery thereof, each separated by platen aligner notches 134.

The distance that each slide is moved, to the left as shown in FIG. 14, is determined by the size of the respective projection 1'. Each projection 101' is sized to move the print wheel 129 to position the respective print character 133, designating one portion of the code assigned to the person having the respective key 98, to a position to record the code characters representing the respective key.

In the illustrated structure, each gear lever 132 is pivotally mounted on an elongated rod or shaft 135 and a roller 136 is rotatably mounted on each gear lever 132 and positioned to firmly engage the respective slide 126. The gear lever 132 has a gear portion 135 having teeth 132' thereon for meshing with the teeth of the gear 131 and a lever portion 136 having the roller 136 mounted thereon. The elongated rod or shaft 135 is positioned at the intersection of the gear portion and the lever portion whereby movement of the respective slide 126 rotates the print wheel 129 to position a representative print character 133, corresponding to the respective projection 101 of the key 98, for. recording the representative code designation of the person assigned to the respective key 98. A suitable resilient member, such as a spring 137, has opposite ends connected to the gear lever 132 and to the slide 126 respectively to position therespective print wheel 129 in a neutral position and overcome any play between the gear teeth 132' and the teeth of the gear 131,
