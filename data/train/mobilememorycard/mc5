Description

    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    [0001]
    The present invention relates to a system, a mobile information terminal, an external device, method and program for executing content. In the system the mobile information terminal acquires a right of using content and the content is executed on the external device that communicates with the mobile information terminal.
    DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART
    [0002]
    Recent mobile information terminals like a cellular phone download content and execute it. However, in a view of the protection of copyright and other rights concerning to the use of content, the downloaded content is designed to stay inside a mobile information terminal and cannot be carried outside of a mobile information terminal.
    [0003]
    To replay multimedia content, a display screen of a mobile information terminal is too small to enjoy the quality of multimedia content. At a situation in which user is outside or moving, a mobile information terminal may satisfy user's need but if there exists an external device with a higher quality than a mobile information terminal, it will give larger satisfaction to user to replay content data on the external device.
    [0004]
    Here an “external” device means that the device exists outside of a mobile information terminal by itself.
    [0005]
    From a provider's side, the execution of content should be restricted to those who purchased or properly acquired a ticket.
    [0006]
    As a method of protecting copyright, a DRM (Digital Rights Management) system is well known. In the DRM system, user freely obtains content but needs a license issued from a license server to replay it. Copyright is protected in this way.
    [0007]
    Prior documents are introduced below.
    [0008]
    Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-8254 aims to improve human interface, displaying a map at a larger display than that of a cellular phone.
    [0009]
    Even though a display device with a larger screen is used, the condition of the use of content is not considered. Further, the fact that data is accepted by a mobile information terminal from a server will cause an increase of load when content data are comparatively large or accesses are excessively concentrated.
    [0010]
    In Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-285417, a mobile information terminal replays music data stored in a memory card and the replayed music data is transferred to a speaker through a connector.
    [0011]
    Capacity of a memory card is not large enough to execute a high sound and picture quality data and the large data for a long hour replay. The data is originally designed to match with the performance of a mobile information terminal so even if the data is given to a sound player, the music is not replayed in a higher quality. Further, a mobile information terminal replays the data stored in a memory card so it cannot cope with streaming data.
    [0012]
    In Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-311962, an external device, which has a smaller capacity, purchases content, downloads pictures and lyrics, and at this process reduces the information attached to the content data so that the content data are efficiently downloaded.
    [0013]
    In this system, the external device with a small capacity cannot handle a higher sound and picture quality data.
    [0014]
    In Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-297816, the number of issuance of a license is recorded and licenses are sent to others freely. In this way, content is replayed easily on any device.
    [0015]
    In this system it is meaningless to identify the user who first purchased a license or a device that first acquired a license because those who possess a license can execute content data on any device. Further, those who possess a license can execute content data as much as the numbers of the use of content permit.
    [0016]
    Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-258008 adapts the similar system and makes a limit to the numbers of the use of content.
    [0017]
    As described above, in conventional systems there are problems that the load to a system increases, the performance of a hardware for replaying data is not brought out enough, a system does not correspond to streaming data and the one who got a license does not match with the one who commands an execution of content data.
    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
    [0018]
    It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide solutions to the above-mentioned problems.
    [0019]
    A mobile information terminal acquires a right (ticket) to execute content. An external device of higher performance, compared with a mobile information terminal, executes content after receiving the ticket from a mobile information terminal. Though content and ticket can move freely in a system, once the content is executed, an identifier for identifying the mobile information terminal that demanded the execution of content is liked with the ticket. It is this mobile information terminal that can use the same ticket again.

    The encoding/decoding section 27 encodes content data and a ticket, and decodes encoded data. The encoding/decoding section 27 provides a secure communication.
    [0063]
    <Operation of the System>
    [0064]
    This embodiment can be divided into the following three scenes:
    [0065]
    (I) Preparation.
    [0066]
    (II) Use of content at a mobile information terminal.
    [0067]
    (III) Use of content at an external device.
    [0068]
    These scenes are explained in detail below.
    [0069]
    <(I) Preparation>
    [0070]
    At the preparation, it is prepared to distribute content data. A provider of content puts content data in the content server 4. The content data are linked with content IDs. The content ID is delivered to the ticket server 3.
    [0071]
    These information delivered to the ticket server 3 are included in a ticket as a part of ticket information when a mobile information terminal gets the ticket.
    [0072]
    Content data may be encoded and put in the content server 4. In this case, a key for decoding the data is delivered to the ticket server 3 with a content ID.
    [0073]
    <(II) Use of Content at a Mobile Information Terminal>
    [0074]
    Here is described an outline of the process in which a user enjoys content without an external device near him or her.
    [0075]
    [0075]FIG. 4 is a sequence diagram of the operation explained below.
    [0076]
    Step A-1: User needs a ticket to execute certain content so he/she operates the demand reception section 11 of the mobile information terminal 1. Then the mobile information terminal 1 checks to the ticket management section 13 whether an appropriate ticket exists in the storage section 16, and informs the user of the information through the demand reception section 11.
    [0077]
    If the ticket exists, the process goes to step A-4.
    [0078]
    Step A-2: If the ticket does not exist, the user demands a ticket at the demand reception section 11 and the information is transferred to the ticket management section 13. The ticket management section 13 communicates with the ticket server 3 through the communication section 14 and asks for an issuance of a ticket. In this case, the ticket management section 13 may ask the user a condition of the use of content through the demand reception section 11, then inform the ticket server 3 of the user's response and instruct the ticket server 3 to issue a ticket including the condition of the use of content. In this process the encoding/decoding section 17 establishes secure communications.
    [0079]
    The ticket includes at least the following information:
    [0080]
    (1) Content ID.
    [0081]
    (2) Content server's address.
    [0082]
    (3) Condition of the use of content (a limit for a frequency of use, a limit for accumulated time of use, etc.).
    [0083]
    (4) Decoding key for content data (if the key is needed).
    [0084]
    Step A-3: The ticket management section 13 stores the ticket in the storage section 16 and informs the demand reception section 11 of the existence of the ticket.
    [0085]
    Step A-4: The user operates the demand reception section 11, selects the ticket and demands the execution of content. The demand reception section 11 sends the demand to the content management section 12.
    [0086]
    The content management section 12 searches the storage section 16 for the content corresponding to a content ID in the ticket. If the requested content exists, the process goes to step A-7.
    [0087]
    Step A-5: If the content does not exist, the content management section 12, through the communication section 14, communicates with the content server 4 that is identified by a content server address in the ticket, and obtains the content data corresponding to a content ID in the tickets.
    [0088]
    Step A-6: The content management section 12 stores the content data in the storage section 16.
    [0089]
    Step A-7: The player 15 is booted, taking in a condition of the use of content from the ticket. In this process a decoding key for the content data may be transferred together to the player 15.
    [0090]
    The player 15, making sure that the condition of the use of content is valid, reads in the content data and executes it.
    [0091]
    When the content data is encoded, the encoding/decoding section 17 delivers the decoded content data to the player 15. Or the player 15 may access to the encoding/decoding section 17 and then the content data is decoded. In this way the decoding process can be realized.
    [0092]
    The encoding/decoding section 17 decodes the content data in the decoding process.
    [0093]
    The content data is decoded based on the information of a decoding key alone. Alternatively, a decoding key may be generated from plural of key information, namely the information of a decoding key, the information of a key attached to content data and the information of a key in the mobile information terminal 1. In this case, validity of each of the information is checked, a decoding key is generated and then content data is decoded by that key.
    [0094]
    At the first execution of the content corresponding to the ticket, the information of the ticket is linked with an identifier of a mobile information terminal, which uniquely identifies the mobile information terminal 1, and is stored in the storage section 16 with the identifier. Where a mobile information terminal is a cellular phone, a UIM (User Identity Module) card, which is an IC card used to identify subscribers, can be used as an identifier. Namely, any identifiers that identify a user are applicable.
    [0095]
    At the next execution of the same content corresponding to the previously used ticket, the ticket is checked whether the identifier of a mobile information terminal liked with the ticket is that of the mobile information terminal 1 and then the content is executed.
    [0096]
    In other words, content may be distributed and circulated in any way but in this system content cannot be replayed without a ticket. Further, by linking with a ticket an identifier for identifying the first mobile information terminal that played the content, this system restricts the way ticket is used.
    [0097]
    The method of identifying the first mobile information terminal that has used content is not restricted to an identifier of a mobile information terminal but other methods can be applicable.
    [0098]
    The player 15 stops when the demand reception section 11 receives from user an instruction to halt, or when user reaches the limit that the condition of the use of content defines.
    [0099]
    Step A-8: When user reaches the limit defined by the condition of the use of content, the ticket becomes invalid. For example, where the condition of the use of content is that user can run the player 15 one hour, then the player 15 halts after one hour passes. Where the condition of the use of content defines that user can run the player 15 only once, the player 15 stops after the whole content is replayed.
    [0100]
    User is informed of the end of replay through the demand reception section 11.
    [0101]
    Where streaming data is supplied, user does not have to obtain and store content data. Thus the above-mentioned steps from step A-4 to step A-6 are skipped. A streaming type of content can be replayed by only booting the player 15 at step A-7.
    [0102]
    Where the storage section 16 is a removable memory card, user can get tickets or content by inserting a removable memory card into a kiosk terminal that is able to function as the ticket server 3 and the content server 4. Here a kiosk terminal is an outfit that provides content like a video-game content, placed in a convenience store.
    [0103]
    A ticket that has not ever been used can be a gift for other people. An identifier of a first mobile information terminal that plays the content is linked with a ticket so that a purchaser and a user of a ticket can be different person.
    [0104]
    <(III) Use of Content at an External Device>
    [0105]
    User may be able to access to an external device that has a high quality large screen or a high quality audio system around him/her (in his/her house, inside a store, etc.). The operation of a replay of content on the external device 2 is explained below.
    [0106]
    If the mobile information terminal 1 in the scene (II) above does not have a ticket, the mobile information terminal 1 performs step A-1 in (II) and acquires a ticket.
    [0107]
    [0107]FIG. 5 is a sequence diagram of the operation of the system in which the mobile information terminal 1 possesses a ticket.
    [0108]
    Step B-1: The mobile information terminal 1 informs the external device 2 that the mobile information terminal 1 has a right to use the external device 2, and requests the execution of content. The demand reception section 11 selects the ticket corresponding to the content that user wishes to replay on the external device 2, and informs it to the ticket management section 13. The ticket management section 13 takes out the ticket from the storage section 16 and informs the external device 2 through the communication section 14 of the information of the condition for utilizing the external device 2. The information includes the condition of the use of content. In this embodiment the condition of the use of content is that user can utilize the external device 2 only once.
    [0109]
    Condition of the use of content is not restricted to the number of use but may be replaced with a period of time.
    [0110]
    Communication is established between the communication sections 14 and 24 of the mobile information terminal 1 and the external device 2. The encoding/decoding sections 17 and 27 provide a secure channel.
    [0111]
    If there are plural devices that work as the external device 2, user must designate one device.
    [0112]
    In this embodiment the communication between the mobile information terminal 1 and the external device 2 is realized by an infrared remote control of directivity or a non-contact IC card. User holds the mobile information terminal 1 over the external device 2 so that the information of the condition for utilizing an external device is transferred and simultaneously one external device is chosen.
    [0113]
    When the content corresponding to a ticket is executed for the first time, the information of the ticket stored in the storage section 16 is linked with an identifier that uniquely identifies the mobile information terminal 1 and is stored in the storage section 16 together with the identifier. Where a mobile information terminal being a cellular phone, a UIM card can be used as an identifier. Namely, any identifiers that identify a user are applicable.
    [0114]
    At the next time to replay the content corresponding to the same ticket, an identifier liked with the ticket is checked whether it matches with the identifier of the mobile information terminal 1 and then the content is replayed.
    [0115]
    The information of the condition for utilizing an external device in this step includes at least the following elements:
    [0116]
    (1) Content ID.
    [0117]
    (2) Content server address.
    [0118]
    (3) Condition of the use of content.
    [0119]
    (4) Decoding key for content data (if necessary).
    [0120]
    (5) Key in a mobile information terminal (if necessary).
    [0121]
    When the storage section 16 of the mobile information terminal 1 is a removable memory card, user may remove the memory card, which stores the above-mentioned information of the condition for utilizing an external device, from the mobile information terminal 1 and then insert it to the external device 2. In this way, the information of the condition for utilizing an external device is transferred to the external device 2.
    [0122]
    Step B-2: After sending a demand for executing content to the external device 2, the mobile information terminal 1 terminates the communication with the external device 2 and rewrites the condition of the use of content in a ticket.
    [0123]
    For example, when the condition of the use of content is defined as a book of five coupons, now the mobile information terminal 1 has demanded one execution to the external device 2, the mobile information terminal 1 decreases one coupon and this leaves four coupons. The ticket management section 13 rewrites the condition of the use of content in a ticket and stores it in the storage section 16.
    [0124]
    Step B-3: The external device 2 receives the condition of utilizing an external device and then the demand reception section 21 delivers it to the ticket management section 23.
    [0125]
    The ticket management section 23 does not store it into the storage section 26. The demand reception section 21 demands the execution of content to the content management section 22.
    [0126]
    The content management section 22 searches the storage section 26 for the content data indicated by the content ID included in the condition of utilizing an external device. If the content data exist, the process goes to step B-6.
    [0127]
    Step B-4: If the content data do not exist, the external device 2 obtains the content data from the mobile information terminal 1 or the content server 4.
    [0128]
    When the external device 2 obtains the content data from the content server 4, the content management section 22 communicates through the communication section 24 with the content server 4, which is specified by a content server address included in the condition of utilizing an external device, and obtains the content data distinguished by a content ID included in the condition of utilizing an external device. At this process, the external device 2 may give to the content server 4 a request for a high quality replay. That request may either include or not include the property information of the external device like device's product name and device's name. If the content server 4 possesses the corresponding high quality content data, the high quality content data can be downloaded to the external device 2. Without a request for a high quality replay, the external device 2 obtains the content data of the same quality for the mobile information terminal 1.
    [0129]
    In this way, content is replayed, matching with the performance of the external device 2.
    [0130]
    When the external device 2 obtains the content data from the mobile information terminal 1, the content management section 22 inquires of the content management section 12 whether the content data exist, and if they exist, temporarily obtains the data. The data are deleted from the external device 2 after the replay of the content finishes.
    [0131]
    Between the above two ways, to obtain the data from a mobile information terminal or an external device, whichever way can be chosen (FIG. 6 does not show an arrow to indicate the acquisition of data from the mobile information terminal 1).
    [0132]
    Step B-5: The content management section 22 stores the content data in the storage section 26.
    [0133]
    Step B-6: The player 25 is booted, given the condition of the use of content. If required, the decoding key for the content data is also given to the player 25.
    [0134]
    The player 25, confirming that the condition of the use of content is valid, reads in the content data and replays them.
    [0135]
    In the case of dealing with the encoded content data, the encoding/decoding section 27 decodes the data and passes them to the player 25. The encoded content data may be accepted by the player 25. In this case the player 25 calls in the encoding/decoding section 27 and then the data is decoded.
    [0136]
    The encoding/decoding section 27 decodes content data by the decoding key alone or generates a new decoding key from a decoding key for content data and a key attached to the content data. Each key is checked for its validity and then a new key is generated.
    [0137]
    Step B-7: When user wishes to stop a replay running on the external device 2, a user issues the demand from the demand reception section 11. This demand is transferred to the ticket management section 13.
    [0138]
    The ticket management section 13 gets an identifier of the mobile information terminal and sends it with a stop demand to the external device 2 through the communication section 14. The external device 2 receives and transfers them to the demand reception section 21.
    [0139]
    To examine that a demand is sent from the mobile information terminal 1 that demanded the execution of content, the identifier is compared with the identifier of a mobile information terminal, which is included in the condition of utilizing an external device and stored in the storage section 26. After the demand is confirmed to have come from the same mobile information terminal, the demand reception section 21 orders the player 25 to stop.
    [0140]
    The player 25 stops replaying the content. Even without a stop demand, the player stops when the condition of the use of content reaches the limit.
    [0141]
    Step B-8: The ticket management section 23 deletes the condition of utilizing an external device, informed that the execution of content ended.
    [0142]
    Dealing with streaming data, user does not have to get content data. As a result, the steps from B-3 to B-5 become unnecessary and streaming data is replayed by booting the player 25 at step B-6.
    [0143]
    When the storage section 26 is a removable memory card, user can obtain content data, inserting the memory card into a kiosk terminal that functions as the content server 4.
    [0144]
    When the storage section 16 in the mobile information terminal is also a removable memory card, the information of a user of an external device can be written into the memory card at the mobile information terminal 1. If the mobile information terminal 1 has content data, supposing the size of the content data is smaller than the capacity of the memory card, the information of a user of an external device and the content data can be carried together in the memory card to the external device 2.
    Effect of this Embodiment
    [0145]
    The first embodiment produces the following effect.
    [0146]
    Firstly, a provider of content can protect rights like copyright.
    [0147]
    This is because user cannot execute content on a mobile information terminal without a ticket. Further, content can be executed only on the same mobile information terminal that used the ticket for the first time and has the same identifier with that of a mobile information terminal in a ticket. Content also cannot be executed on an external device unless a mobile information terminal has a ticket.
    [0148]
    Secondly, the same content that is originally expected to run on a mobile information terminal can be executed in higher sound and picture quality.
    [0149]
    This is because an external device has a better performance than a mobile information terminal. In this embodiment user purchases by a mobile information terminal a right for enjoying content, transmits it to an external device and replays it on an external device. Comparing with a mobile information terminal, an external device can accept content data of higher quality.
    [0150]
    Thirdly, user can select the most appropriate device for executing content in a given circumstance.
    [0151]
    User always carries a mobile information terminal and under certain circumstances in which external devices exist, the user can transmit a ticket from a mobile information terminal to the desired external device.
    [0152]
    Fourthly, user does not have to newly purchase a ticket for the use of an external device.
    [0153]
    If a mobile information terminal possesses a ticket, then user only has to transmit it to an external device.
    [0154]
    Fifthly, a content provider can disperse the load of servers.
    [0155]
    This is because a ticket has a server address and from the server corresponding to the address, content data is downloaded.
    [0156]
    Sixthly, any type of content player is applicable in this system.
    [0157]
    This is because the content management sections 12 and 22 control the players 15 and 25 respectively.
    [0158]
    Under a DRM (Digital Rights Management) system in a PC, a content player must have a component designed for DRM.
    [0159]
    In this embodiment, however, the content management sections 12 and 22 can even control a player that does not work under a DRM system. So user selects a player according to the condition of the use of content. This means that various types of content player are applicable and a system can be built less expensively.
    [0160]
    Seventhly, an external device refuses demands from a mobile information terminal without a ticket.
    [0161]
    When the mobile information terminal sends a demand to an external device, it also sends an identifier of a mobile information terminal. In this way, an external device is controlled only by a mobile information terminal that possesses a ticket.
    Second Embodiment
    [0162]
    This embodiment has the same structure as that of the first embodiment.
    [0163]
    [0163]FIG. 6 is a sequence diagram of this embodiment. Steps different from the first embodiment are explained here.
    [0164]
    Step C-1: In the first embodiment, the condition of utilizing an external device is a one-time execution. In this embodiment, the condition of utilizing an external device further includes an identifier for a mobile information terminal, which uniquely identifies a mobile information terminal.
    [0165]
    This identifier, when a mobile information terminal is a cellular phone, may be a UIM card.
    [0166]
    The aim of including the identifier is to identify the mobile information terminal that corresponds to the information in a ticket.
    [0167]
    The external device 2 sends an identifier of an external device, which uniquely identifies an external device, to a mobile information terminal.
    [0168]
    The condition of utilizing an external device includes at least the following information:
    [0169]
    Identifier of a mobile information terminal
    [0170]
    Ticket
    [0171]
    Information of key in a mobile information terminal
    [0172]
    The Identifier of an external device includes at least the following information:
    [0173]
    ID for an external device
    [0174]
    Information of location
    [0175]
    Step C-2: The mobile information terminal 1 stores the identifier of an external device sent from the external device 2 in the storage section 16. The external device 2 stores the condition of utilizing an external device in the storage section 26.
    [0176]
    The steps from C-3 to C-7 are the same with the steps from B-3 to B-7.
    [0177]
    Step C-8: The condition of utilizing an external device is updated. For example, if a ticket is defined as a book of coupons, coupons are decreased according to the numbers of the execution of content.
    [0178]
    Step C-9: User gets back a ticket. User orders it from the demand reception section 21. This demand is informed to the ticket management section 13 and an identifier of an external device is obtained from the storage section 16. The demand and the identifier are put together and sent to the external device 2 through the communication section 14. The external device 2 receives and transfers them to the demand reception section 21.
    [0179]
    The demand reception section 21 takes out the ticket from the storage section 26 through the ticket management section 23 and sends the ticket to the mobile information terminal 1 through the communication section 24. The condition of utilizing an external device in the storage section 26 is deleted.
    [0180]
    At this step, as step C-7, the identifiers of an external device and of a mobile information terminal are checked.
    [0181]
    Receiving the ticket, the mobile information terminal stores it in the storage section 16. At this point the identifier of an external device is deleted.
    [0182]
    If a ticket is not collected at step C-9, the content stays executable. Namely if the mobile information terminal 1 sends a replay instruction, the external device 2 can execute content. In this case the process go back to step C-3.
    [0183]
    In the case of the execution of streaming data, steps for the acquisition of a ticket can be skipped. So the steps from C-3 to C-5 are unnecessary. The process jumps to step C-6 and streaming data are executed by booting the player 25.
    [0184]
    If user forgets to retrieve the ticket from the external device 2, the identifier of an external device mentioned in step C-1 is displayed on the demand reception section 11. In this way, user knows where the ticket is. In addition, the location of the ticket can be displayed on a map to which the information of the location of an external device is linked.
    [0185]
    A ticket is linked with an identifier of a mobile information terminal when the content corresponding to the ticket is executed for the first time. This process may be performed at step C-6 or C-9.
    Effect of this Embodiment
    [0186]
    The effect of the second embodiment is firstly that user can set the detailed conditions of the use of content on an external device.
    [0187]
    In this embodiment, a ticket is moved from the mobile information terminal 1 to the external device 2. As a result the external device 2 can be controlled based on a ticket. Even if the ticket is defined as a time accumulation type, the accurate time of the execution of content is written on the ticket. Where the ticket is defined as a book of coupons, the communication between the mobile information terminal 1 and the external device 2 to reduce the numbers of coupons is omitted and the amount of communication data decreases.
    [0188]
    Secondly, the external device does not operate by an instruction from a mobile information terminal without a ticket.
    [0189]
    This is because an identifier of a mobile information terminal is sent together with the instruction to the external device 2. The external device 2 only executes the instruction issued from the same mobile information terminal that sends the ticket. Therefore, other mobile information terminals cannot control an external device even if the external device has a ticket in it.
    [0190]
    Thirdly, user can specify an external device in which he or she has left a ticket.
    [0191]
    This is because a mobile information terminal possesses an identifier of an external device. The identifier is sent from an external device when a mobile information terminal transmits a ticket to it.
    [0192]
    Fourthly, the condition of the use of content directed to a mobile information terminal is also applicable to an external device.
    [0193]
    This is because a ticket is sent from a mobile information terminal to an external device and the processes regarding to the ticket are performed on the external device.
    Third Embodiment
    [0194]
    The system of this embodiment is shown on FIG. 7. The differences from FIG. 1 are that the ticket server 3 and the content server 4 are replaced with a content server 5.
    [0195]
    The content server 5 manages both the content data with a ticket and the content data without a ticket.
    [0196]
    The content data with a ticket is the data that can be executed on the mobile information terminal 1 and the amount of the data is comparatively small. The content data without a ticket are either the data similar to the content data with a ticket or the data for a higher quality replay. In the latter case, the amount of the data becomes larger. These two types of content data are executed by the ticket attached to the content data with a ticket.
    [0197]
    The details of the mobile information terminal 1 and the external device 2 are same to that of the first embodiment, namely FIGS. 2 and 3.
    [0198]
    [0198]FIG. 8 is a sequence diagram of this embodiment. The explanation of process is given with FIG. 8.
    [0199]
    Step D-1: User operates the demand reception section 11. The ticket management section 13 looks for the corresponding ticket in the storage section 16. The result is informed to the user through the demand reception section 11.
    [0200]
    If the ticket exists, the process goes to step D-4.
    [0201]
    Step D-2: If the ticket does not exist, the user demands the content data with a ticket and this demand is sent to the content management section 12.
    [0202]
    The content management section 12 communicates with the content server 5 through the communication section 14 and obtains the content data with a ticket. The demand reception section 11 may let user input the condition of the use of content and send the information to the content server 5. Then the content server 5 issues the ticket containing the condition of the use of content. The encoding/decoding section 17 provides a secure communication channel by the encryption/decryption of data.
    [0203]
    The ticket includes at least the following information:
    [0204]
    Content ID
    [0205]
    Content server address
    [0206]
    Condition of the use of content (the numbers of use, the accumulated time of use, etc.)
    [0207]
    Decoding key for content data (if necessary)
    [0208]
    Step D-3: The mobile information terminal 1, acquiring the content data with a ticket, divides it into content data and a ticket.
    [0209]
    Step D-4: The content management section 12 and the ticket management section 13 store the content data and the ticket separately in the storage section 16. At this point the content can be executed on an external device. Namely, the process selects the next step among the steps of D-5 (execution on a mobile information terminal), B-1 and C-1 (execution on an external device).
    [0210]
    Step D-5 and D-6 are the same processes as that of steps A-7 and A-8.
    [0211]
    When the content is executed on an external device, the process is similar to that of steps B-1˜B-7 or C-1˜C-9.
    Effect of this Embodiment
    [0212]
    The third embodiment reduces the amount of communication between a mobile information terminal and a content server.
    [0213]
    This is because a mobile information terminal acquires content with a ticket.
    Fourth Embodiment
    [0214]
    In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 9, an input section 28 is newly added to the external device 2. The other elements are that of the first embodiment.
    [0215]
    The demand reception section 21 handles the information inputted from the input section 28 and this enables user to input commands directly into the external device 2.
    [0216]
    The processes of this embodiment are explained below.
    [0217]
    A sequence diagram for this embodiment is that of the first˜third embodiment, except that steps 7 of each embodiment are replaced with the following step E-7.
    [0218]
    Step E-7: When user wishes to stop the external device 2, the user directly inputs the command into the external device by operating buttons, a GUI (Graphical User Interface) or by a speech input.
    [0219]
    The authentication of an identifier of the mobile information terminal 1 is cancelled at this process.
    [0220]
    The demand reception section 21 orders the player 25 to stop through the content management section 22. Receiving the command, the player 25 stops. An input of an execution command is also realized by the same way.
    Effect of this Embodiment
    [0221]
    This embodiment presents an easy operation of the system because user only has to operate an external device to execute content in it. Namely, except the transmission and reception of a ticket, user directly operates an external device.
    [0222]
    A mobile information terminal establishes communication of some directivity or of short range. In this case the mobile information terminal may need to be fixed in some angle or distance. Direct inputs into an external device cancel this troublesome process.
    Fifth Embodiment
    [0223]
    In this embodiment, the system is applied to a local area network like a network in a store.
    [0224]
    The number of channels and the amount of data running through them are different from the other embodiments.
    [0225]
    The system of this embodiment is the same as that of the first embodiment.
    [0226]
    In this embodiment the process of steps 1 in the 1 st-3 rd embodiments are replaced with step F-1. This embodiment is explained referring to FIG. 10.
    [0227]
    Step F-1: The external device 2 is designated.
    [0228]
    The mobile information terminal 1 sends its address to the external device 2 through the communication section 14. The external device 2 sends its address to the mobile information terminal 1 through the communication section 24. At the same time an encoding key may be transferred to establish secure communication.
    [0229]
    This communication is of some directivity like an infrared communication, a non-contact IC communication, the reading of a bar code in a display etc., or of short range or both. To designate an external device, the mobile information terminal 1 is held over the external device 2 or is connected to it by a cable like USB (Universal Serial Bus).
    [0230]
    Then the mobile information terminal 1 selects a ticket and informs it to the ticket management section 13. The ticket management section 13 picks up the ticket from the storage section 16 and through the communication section 14 sends the condition of utilizing an external device, which includes the condition of the use of content. This communication is of non-directivity, using wireless LAN, Bluetooth, or wire LAN.
    [0231]
    The communication is established between the communication sections 14 and 24. The encoding/decoding section 17 and 27 provides a secure channel. As an encoding key, the key acquired with the address is used.
    [0232]
    In all the steps hereinafter, the communication is of non-directivity.
    [0233]
    In this embodiment, the external device 2 checks whether user exists in neighborhood during the execution of content. This function is set at an initial setting.
    [0234]
    The above function having been set, the external device 2, during the execution of content, sends a signal at a fixed pace to the mobile information terminal 1 to check the existence of a user. The mobile information terminal 1 is specified by the address gotten in step F-1. If the mobile information terminal does not respond to the signal, the external device 2 stops the execution of content.
    [0235]
    The signal may be transmitted from an external device or a mobile information terminal or both—the device and the terminal may communicate interactively.
    Effect of this Embodiment
    [0236]
    By this embodiment, it is no more necessary to think of the location of an external device and the directions of an external device and a mobile information terminal.
    [0237]
    Both a mobile information terminal and an external device know each other's address and the communication of non-directivity is established between them. So user can input the command for an external device in a free style, facing free directions. Only once user has to hold a mobile information terminal over an external device when the addresses are exchanged.
    [0238]
    Secondly, when the mobile information terminal is out of a local area network, the external device stops the execution of content.
    [0239]
    This is because the mobile information terminal and the external device contact each other in a certain period and when the communication ends, the external device concludes that the mobile information terminal is no more nearby.
    Sixth Embodiment
    [0240]
    This embodiment realizes an acquisition of content data based on a Peer to Peer system.
    [0241]
    [0241]FIG. 11 shows the system of this embodiment.
    [0242]
    The difference from FIG. 1 is that a mobile information terminal 6 and an external device 7 are newly added.
    [0243]
    The mobile information terminal 6 has the same construction with the mobile information terminal 1 (FIG. 2). The external device 7 also has the same construction with the external device 2 (FIG. 3).
    [0244]
    However, the content management sections 12 in the mobile information terminals 1 and 6 have a content data discovery function in this embodiment. The content management sections 22 in the external devices 2 and 7 also have a content data discovery function. The content discovery function is a function that looks for the requested content data.
    [0245]
    In this embodiment, the way to obtain content data is different from those of the previous embodiments. Only the different processes (hereinafter called step G-5 and step H-4) are explained below.
    [0246]
    User handles both the mobile information terminal 1 and the external device 2.
    [0247]
    Step G-5: In step A-5, the mobile information terminal 1 obtains content data from the content server 4. In this step, however, the mobile information terminal 1 searches other mobile information terminals for the content data, using the content data discovery function. The search is implemented with a content ID. If the mobile information terminal 6 has the content data, the data is transferred to the mobile information terminal 1. If the content data are not found, the data are obtained from the content server 4.
    [0248]
    Step H-4: In step B-4, the external device 2 obtains content data from the content server 4. In this step, however, the external device 2 searches other external devices for the content data, using the content data discovery function. The search is executed with a content ID. If the external device 7 has the content data, the data are transferred to the external device 2. If the data are not found, the content data are downloaded from the content server 4 as the first embodiment.
    [0249]
    These searches are realized by the same method as a P2P system, in which personal computers communicate directly with each other.
    Effect of this Embodiment
    [0250]
    This embodiment distributes the load of the content server 4.
    [0251]
    If the requested content data exists in other mobile information terminals or external devices, a mobile information terminal or an external device puts a higher priority on that content data. Namely, the content data can be obtained without the communication between the mobile information terminal and the content server 4.
    Effect of this Invention
    [0252]
    As set forth hereinbefore, according to the present invention, only a mobile information terminal with a ticket can execute content data on an external device. In this way copyright is protected.
    [0253]
    Further, content data is selected matching with the performance of an external device so that the content data is replayed in a higher sound and picture quality.
